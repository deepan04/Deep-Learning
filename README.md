# Deep-Learning
Work Related to Neural Networks, Stochastic gradient and CNN

In every folder, there is a PDF which explains the homework

Homework 1: Implemented Loss function and stochastic gradient in SVM classifier

Homerwork 3: Extracted Pascal data set and implemented data auigmentation to generate a data. Also Implemented neural network with dropout to avoid overfitting

Homework 4: Implemented CNN on MNIST data set and achieved 99.3% accuracy. Also, implemented to print output of each convolutional layer.
